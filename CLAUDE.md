# Health Project

This project is a personal knowledge base for maintaining all information about my health issues. It is **not a code project** — it contains medical documents, notes, and working files.

## What we do here

1. **Maintain comprehensive medical summaries** describing my condition (history, test results, timelines, diagnoses)
2. **Write documents for specialists** — concise materials I can hand to a doctor at the start of a visit to provide full context quickly
3. **Brainstorm and triage** treatment ideas, alternative hypotheses, and next steps

## Project structure

- Root-level `.md` and `.txt` files are the **current, active documents**
- `trash/` contains **old versions only** — never read from it, it will only cause confusion
- `.xml` files contain structured medical data (e.g. MRI reports)

## Working guidelines

- I will add all needed documents into the context myself. Do not scan or search for files unless asked — it wastes time
- Never read content from `trash/`
- This is a sensitive medical context. Be precise, factual, and careful with medical terminology
- When writing summaries or documents for doctors, use clear clinical language
- When brainstorming, clearly separate established facts from hypotheses and speculation
