# Dima's Psychological Profile

*Compiled from conversation history (May 2024 - February 2026)*
*Last updated: February 2026*

---

## INTRO: THE MEDICAL SITUATION

Dima has a complex chronic condition involving recurring throat inflammation that has led to two confirmed myocarditis episodes (March 2024, January 2025). The third inflammatory episode began October 2024 and continues.

**The pattern:**
- Throat inflammation (right-sided, atypical presentation) persists for months
- Normal inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) despite active symptoms
- After weeks/months of inflammation → cardiac involvement develops
- Episodes triggered/worsened by stress, but extended rest periods haven't resolved them

**The hypothesis:**
Chronic nervous system dysregulation (ANS dysfunction) drives or amplifies the inflammatory process. The throat symptoms may involve neurogenic inflammation rather than classical immune pathways - supported by:
- Paradoxically normal inflammatory markers during active episodes
- Consistent response to GABAergic medications (gidazepam)
- 10-year history of central sensitization across multiple body systems

**What the AI-therapist needs to know:**
The full medical documentation exists separately. This psychological profile focuses on the patterns, behaviors, and interventions relevant to nervous system regulation. The medical condition provides context but isn't the therapeutic target - the psychological patterns are.

## PART 1: CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS

### 1.1 The Central Problem: Chronic Nervous System Activation

**NOT classic anxiety** - this is a nervous system stuck in "GO" mode that can't discharge or downregulate.

**Key distinction:** It's not worry or catastrophic thinking - it's physical activation without discharge. The body is stuck in sympathetic overdrive.

**Evidence:**
- Walking helps (discharges activation)
- Benzodiazepines work (force nervous system calm)
- Passive rest DOESN'T help (activation remains)
- Extended rest periods (summer 2025 vacation, October 2025 retreat) didn't resolve condition
- Everything becomes physical symptoms

**Baseline state:**
- Constant body tension "always to some extent" - lifelong pattern
- Tension primarily held in hands/legs
- Baseline discomfort so persistent that escape patterns developed
- Clenching (teeth, fists, muscles) throughout day without noticing

### 1.2 Tension Triggers & Escalation Patterns

**Trigger 1: Work Frustration (The "AAAAA" Pattern)**
- Debugging issues cause near-instant escalation (seconds)
- Sequence: "ok, ok, not ok, not ok, not ok, AAAAA!"
- Historical response: push harder and harder
- Now practicing stepping back - "it's difficult"
- This is a KEY intervention target

**Trigger 2: Social Situations**
- Even benign interactions (cafe, strangers) create tension
- Stopped noticing this automatic response
- Recovery time: ~1 hour if went well, full day+ if conflict
- Digital interactions (Slack, emails) also trigger anxiety
- Rehearse conversations before, replay them after

**Trigger 3: Environmental Irritants**
- People talking loudly
- Unexpected disruptions
- Minor frustrations treated as threats

**Trigger 4: Self-Imposed Urgency**
- Deadlines (even self-created) create internal pressure
- Thinking about obligations → body tension + action urge without discharge
- Feeling trapped: can't act but can't relax

**Trigger 5: Meta-Tension Spirals**
- Tension about having tension about having tension
- Layers build even in low-stakes situations

**High-Activation Episodes (100x tension):**
- Historically occurred after prolonged stress (10h work days, no weekends)
- Tension becomes self-sustaining, doesn't need triggers
- Wake up already tense
- This is when cardiac issues historically developed

### 1.3 Recent Lifestyle Changes (Summer 2025 - Present)

**Significant improvements implemented:**
- No more doom scrolling
- Resting on weekends
- Desktop timer every 15 minutes → distract from work, check inside, try to relax
- Generally more calm and peaceful
- Severely limited work: ~4 hours/day of deep work, occasional meetings
- Active emotional management during work (managing frustration and anger)
- Consistent jhana meditation practice: 3-4 hours/day since October 2025

**What contributed:**
- Summer 2025: lots of rest, reduced stress
- October 2025: 2-week meditation retreat
- Ketamine therapy period: month of reflection without other activities (per protocol)
- Combination of all three likely responsible

**Current state (February 2026):** More regulated baseline than historical patterns. Lifestyle is dramatically different from a year ago — less work, more rest, daily meditation, active emotional regulation. Mild to moderate improvement in day-to-day mood (largely from jhana practice). However, the core medical problem — the recurring throat/cold-like syndrome that leads to cardiac involvement — remains unchanged despite all these changes.

### 1.4 Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder)

**NOT classic depression** - more accurately Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia)

**Timeline:**
- Childhood: shy, vulnerable, anxious temperament
- Age 13+: grey baseline mood developed and persisted
- Present: continues as baseline state

**Characteristics:**
- Mood usually low or neutral - "grey days, not bad, but nothing good really"
- Rarely experience genuine happiness or joy
- Constant background psychological discomfort
- Sense of "something missing" - a hole in my heart to fill
- Deep underlying sadness that never fully goes away

**Critical nuance - mood IS reactive:**
- Responds to coffee, gym, physical state, circumstances
- CAN experience pleasure on better days
- Functions well enough (work, daily activities)
- Probably wouldn't score highly on standard depression questionnaires

**During flares:** Dysthymia (baseline) + situational depression (from being sick) → drops to 1/10
**When physically okay:** Returns to baseline grey state, which feels "good" relative to flares

**The core craving:** Joy itself, not joy from something. "Even meaning.. when I feel joy there is no question about meaning."

### 1.5 Social Anxiety & Isolation

**Historical trajectory:**
- Social anxiety IMPROVED significantly over last 10 years (through exposure/work/dates)
- Before: unemployed, not working or studying
- Now: can function professionally, go on dates

**Current state:**
- Increased isolation last 3-5 years due to:
  - Divorce (3 years ago)
  - COVID/remote work (5 years ago)
- Still uncomfortable and unable to relax around others
- Social interactions remain draining
- Body image issues and dating anxiety (especially with illness)
- Loneliness as major stressor - "feels like loneliness erodes my soul"

### 1.6 Escape & Distraction Patterns

**Historical pattern:** Feel discomfort → escape into head/Twitter/work

**Doom scrolling (HISTORICAL - largely resolved):**
- Used to: hours of tense, miserable scrolling
- Never satisfied, stop only when exhausted or feeling sick
- Not enjoyable - automatic escape from body/mind discomfort
- **Current:** No longer doing this since lifestyle changes

**Work as escape:**
- Can work many days straight when hyperfocused
- Or do nothing for months when procrastinating
- NOT always escape - when work feels good, it just feels good (genuinely enjoyable)

**Attention ratio (historical):** 5/95 - 5% external world, 95% internal discomfort
**Current:** Improved but exact ratio unknown

### 1.7 Work Patterns: Procrastination-Perfectionism Cycle

**Procrastination Phase:**
- Can last months before starting projects
- Massive resistance to beginning
- Rumination about the work without doing it

**Transformation to "Video Game Mode":**
- Once started, becomes unstoppable hyperfocus
- When work "clicks" - genuinely enjoyable, not just escape
- Perfectionism kicks in: "I can do even better and they will see!"
- Sweet spot: After solving unknowns and having clear implementation path
- Usually happens late at night

**Work Intensity:**
- Occasionally work couple weeks without weekends (not extreme but happens)
- More typically: irregular patterns of intense work followed by low activity
- Rarely work more than 4-6 hours sustainably
- Two remote jobs, both "difficult shit, Dima will solve it" roles

**Energy Management:**
- Feel drained after eating (skip breakfast, late lunch)
- Best energy combo: cardio + coffee + heavy music (1-3 hours feeling alive)

---

## PART 2: HYPOTHESIZED ROOT MECHANISMS

### 2.1 Working Theory

**Core of chronic tension:** Suppression/resistance to pain and discomfort + fear of pain/discomfort

**Downstream from:**
- Social phobia (lifelong pattern)
- Inability to feel fully safe
- Nervous system never learned to downregulate

**The feedback loop:**
1. Body experiences discomfort (physical or emotional)
2. Automatic resistance/tensing against the discomfort
3. Resistance itself creates more tension
4. Fear of discomfort maintains hypervigilance
5. Unable to relax because relaxing means feeling the discomfort fully
6. Nervous system remains in defensive "GO" mode

### 2.2 Evidence AGAINST Simple Stress Model

**Critical finding:** Extended periods without overactivation didn't resolve inflammation:
- Summer 2025: Nearly entire summer, minimal stress
- October 2025: 2-week retreat, no devices, no work, meditation, gym, walking, reading
- Winter 2025-2026: Sustained lifestyle change — ~4h/day work, 3-4h/day jhana meditation, active emotional management, minimal stress exposure
- **Symptoms persisted despite all of these periods**

**Implications:**
- Either overactivation plays lesser role than initially thought
- Or condition has become self-perpetuating through neuroplastic changes
- Or nervous system dysregulation persists even without acute stressors
- Or root cause is deeper than situational stress
- Note: Even 3-4 hours/day of deep meditative rest (including reliably pleasurable jhana states) has not moved the needle on the medical condition — this is a strong data point against simple "rest and de-stress" models (though jhana practice has produced mild-to-moderate mood improvement separately)

### 2.3 Central Sensitization Pattern (10-Year History)

**Pattern of pain amplification across multiple body systems:**

1. **Alcohol-triggered pelvic pain** (10 years ago - present)
   - Even 0.3% alcohol triggers burning urination lasting hours to days
   - Multiple ultrasounds show no structural issues

2. **Persistent daily headache** (4-5 year period)
   - One day became constant (episodic → chronic overnight)
   
3. **Chronic back pain** (4 years ago - present)
   - From minor trauma (jumping from 0.5m)
   - Stress brings back symptoms for 1-2 weeks

4. **Widespread fibromyalgia-like pain** (4 years ago)
   - Started during acute back pain episode
   - Stress brings it back

**Common features:**
- Disproportionate response: minor triggers → major/prolonged symptoms
- No structural damage found
- Stress as reactivation trigger
- Progressive sensitization over decade

**Current throat/cardiac condition fits this pattern.**

## PART 3: WHAT HELPS & WHAT DOESN'T

### 3.1 Reliable Interventions

**Walking:**
- 50-80% symptom reduction during flares
- Can resolve flares in 4-5 days
- Passive rest allows episodes to persist 3-5 weeks
- Mechanism: discharge of activation + vagal stimulation

**Gidazepam (Benzodiazepine):**
- Consistently effective across 4+ trials
- Improves throat pain AND fatigue/malaise
- Suggests GABAergic pathways involved
- Note: developed tolerance after ~5 months continuous use

**Jhana Meditation (established practice since October 2025):**
- Consistent 3-4 hours/day practice since October 2025
- More or less reliable access to Jhana 1 or Jhana 2
- Good weeks: can spend hours in jhana states
- Bad weeks: sometimes reaches the states, sometimes close but not fully there
- States are genuinely pleasurable
- Can practice while walking
- **Mood benefit:** Mild to moderate improvement in day-to-day mood; during peak states, mood is significantly better than baseline
- **However:** Has not improved the core medical problem (throat/cold-like syndrome → cardiac involvement)
- Even 4 hours/day of deep meditative rest doesn't translate into improvement of the inflammatory condition

### 3.2 What Didn't Work or Made Things Worse

**Passive rest:** Activation remains, symptoms persist
**Strict elimination diet:** Likely created food intolerances through restriction
**Aggressive anti-reflux meds:** First heartburn in life appeared AFTER starting PPIs
**Propofol + ketamine combo:** Felt worse afterwards (relaxed but depressed)
**Escitalopram (full trial, completed):** 4 months total, 2 months on full dose 20mg/day — no results despite early promising signals
**LDN (full trial, completed):** 4 months on full dose 4.5mg/day — no results
**Ketamine therapy (8 sessions):** No direct improvement in throat/inflammatory symptoms, mild psychological benefits
**Stellate ganglion block (2 procedures):** No apparent improvement
**Various nootropics:** Bromantane, phenylpiracetam, GB-115 - no effect

### 3.3 Current Medications

- Pregabalin 75mg x2
- Mirtazapine 15mg
- Gidazepam 30mg (tolerance developed, planning taper)
- Cardiac meds: carvedilol, ramipril, colchicine
- *Escitalopram and LDN discontinued after full trials with no results*

### 3.4 Current Practices

- Jhana meditation 3-4 hours/day (established daily practice)
- Severely limited work (~4h/day deep work, minimal meetings)
- Active emotional management during work (frustration, anger)
- 15-minute timer during work → check inside, relax
- Weekend rest (established habit)
- Ring counter for pattern interruption
- Food reintroduction (shifted from restriction)
- Walking

## PART 4: STRATEGIC SHIFTS & KEY INSIGHTS

### 4.1 The Acceptance Shift (Late 2025)

**From:** Treating this as a battle, aggressive intervention
**To:** Softer approach, acceptance, less monitoring

**Concrete changes:**
- More food, including sweets
- Using symptom relief measures freely
- Going to gym even with mild sore throat
- Reduced frequency of MRI/echo/cardiologist visits
- Less catastrophizing about triggers

**Rationale:** "The nervous system has become so sensitized that minimal triggers cause significant reactions. More logical to address the amplification response than chase increasingly small triggers."

### 4.2 Key Insight: Joy as the Goal

"The only thing I crave is joy. Even meaning.. when I feel joy there is no question about meaning. Even love.. if there is no joy love becomes a tragedy."

**Before myocarditis:** Drugs provided reliable joy
**After myocarditis:** Drug use became too risky
**Current path:** Jhanas as sustainable tool for anhedonia — after 4+ months of consistent practice with reliable jhana access, there is mild to moderate improvement in day-to-day mood, and peak states feel significantly better than baseline. This works for mood. It has not, however, improved the core medical problem (throat syndrome → cardiac involvement).

## PART 5: PATTERNS TO TRACK

### 5.1 Primary Intervention Targets

**1. The "AAAAA → Push Harder" Pattern**
- Goal: Practice stepping back during escalation
- Current: Trying but finds it difficult
- Intervention: Real-time interrupt, ring counter tracking

**2. Tension Awareness & Micro-Release**
- Goal: Notice tension building earlier, release before accumulation
- Current: 15-min timer helping, but can still miss buildup
- Intervention: Timed check-ins, body scan prompts

**3. Meta-Tension Spirals**
- Goal: Interrupt the "tension about tension" loops
- Intervention: Pattern labeling, normalization, redirect

### 5.2 Tracking Schema

**Daily metrics:**
- Baseline tension AM/PM (1-10)
- Ring counter clicks (successful interrupts)
- Tension spikes count (7+ episodes)
- Throat pain (1-10)
- Mood (1-10)
- Notable triggers
- What worked

---

## PART 6: COGNITIVE PATTERNS

### 6.1 Distortions Present

**Catastrophizing:**
- "Tomorrow I will be much more miserable" (after eating trigger food)
- Predicting flares before they happen
- Creating tomorrow's misery tonight

**All-or-Nothing:**
- Procrastination OR hyperfocus (historically, improving)
- Battle mode OR giving up

**Emotional Reasoning:**
- Tension feels dangerous → must be dangerous
- Body screams threat → threat must be real

**Fortune-telling:**
- Predicting exact consequences of triggers
- Often wrong (70-80% correlation ≠ 100%)

### 6.2 What's NOT Present

- Excessive rumination about past (more present-focused)
- Panic attacks
- Classic worry spirals
- Specific phobias
- Paranoid ideation

---

## PART 7: SOMATIC AWARENESS (IFS-COMPATIBLE)

### 7.1 Parts to Recognize

**The Pusher**
- Voice: "I can do even better and they will see!"
- Shows up: Late night work, perfectionism phase

**The Escape Artist**
- Voice: Silence (just scrolling, in head)
- Shows up: Discomfort → automatic escape
- Note: Less active since lifestyle changes

**The Perfectionist/Procrastinator** (same part, different faces)
- Voice Procrastination: "Not ready, not now"
- Voice Perfectionism: "Must be perfect"

**The Tension Holder**
- Voice: None (pure body)
- Location: Hands, legs, clenching

**The Threat Detector**
- Voice: "Something bad will happen"
- Shows up: Baseline pessimism
- Note: More due to lack of joy than active threat scanning

---

## PART 8: DISCHARGE & REGULATION MENU

### 8.1 Vagal Activation

**Cold water:**
- Face immersion or splash
- Triggers diving reflex

**Humming/Gargling:**
- Already gargles chlorhexidine daily
- Add humming for vagal stimulation

**Physiological Sigh:**
- Double inhale + long exhale
- Fast-acting nervous system reset

### 8.2 Practices

**Jhana Meditation:**
- Primary tool for pleasure generation
- Can do while walking
- Recent breakthrough to first jhana

**Walking:**
- Most reliable intervention
- 50-80% symptom reduction
- Combines discharge + vagal stimulation

**15-Minute Timer Protocol:**
- During work: pause, check inside, relax
- Already implemented and helping
