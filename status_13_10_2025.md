## Document Status
**Last Updated:** November 19, 2025  
**Coverage Period:** December 2021 - November 2025  
**Note:** This document represents the medical situation and findings as of the last update date.

## Patient Demographics
**Sex:** Male  
**Age:** 39 years  
**Weight:** 50 kg  
**Height:** 170 cm  
**BMI:** 17.3 (underweight)

## Terminology and Pattern Definitions

**Episode**: A prolonged period (months) of persistent symptoms with only brief symptom-free intervals. Between episodes, there are several-month remissions with minimal symptoms. Three episodes have occurred so far.

**Flare**: An acute worsening within an episode, lasting several days to weeks. Flares follow a predictable but approximate architecture:
- Day 1: Increased throat pain
- Days 1-3 (approximately): Systemic symptoms (fatigue, temperature up to 37.3°C, chills)
- Days 4-7 (approximately): Gradual improvement in systemic symptoms
- Post-flare: Throat pain persists at lower intensity

**Current Status (October 2025)**: The third episode began in October 2024 and continues (over 1 year duration). Recent months show constant symptoms ranging from 3-7/10 severity (where 1 = no symptoms, 10 = severe strep throat).

## Introduction
A complex medical condition characterized by recurring episodes of subacute myocarditis preceded by distinctive throat and neck inflammation patterns. First presenting in December 2022, the condition has led to two confirmed cases of myocarditis (March 2024 and January 2025), both following extended periods of throat inflammation and immune system changes. Despite various interventions, including tonsillectomy and antibiotic treatments, the condition continues to recur with a consistent pattern. The primary concern is understanding the connection between the chronic inflammatory process and cardiac involvement to prevent further cardiac complications.

## Clinical Timeline

### Possible Early Episode (December 2021)
- Symptoms suggesting possible undiagnosed myocarditis:
  * Chest pain
  * One episode of fainting
  * Feeling of losing consciousness
- Emergency room findings:
  * Normal troponins and ECG
  * Normal echocardiogram (EF 60%)
  * Low-normal CRP (1.9 mg/L)
- Concurrent throat infection:
  * Diagnosed with chronic tonsillitis
  * Throat culture showed multiple bacteria:
    - Streptococcus spp (10^6 CFU/sample)
    - Enterococcus faecalis (10^4 CFU/sample)
    - Acinetobacter baumannii (10^3 CFU/sample)
  * Blood work showed:
    - Normal WBC but low eosinophils
    - Normal inflammatory markers
- No cardiac diagnosis made at the time

### First Episode (Winter 2022-2023)
- Duration: ~2 months (December 2022 - February 2023)
- Resolution: Achieved through sustained walking regimen
- No cardiac involvement

### Second Episode (Fall 2023 - Summer 2024)
- Extended period (October 2023 - July 2024)
- Significant inflammatory episode (November 2023):
  * Elevated CRP: 51.3 mg/L (normal: <10)
  * High neutrophils: 87% (normal: 40-70%)
  * Low lymphocytes: 5% (normal: 20-44%)
  * Zero eosinophils (normal: 0.5-5.5%)
  * Elevated ESR: 14 mm/hr (normal: <10)
  These changes suggested active inflammation three months before myocarditis diagnosis
- First heart inflammation (subacute myocarditis) diagnosis: March 2024
  * Mild symptoms: moderate/mild chest pain, some fatigue
  * Ejection fraction initially decreased to 40%, quickly improved to 53%
  * Condition was likely developing for a month before noticeable symptoms
- Key Treatments and Events:
  * Before heart issues: Managed with walking/gym
  * After heart inflammation + throat infection:
    - First treatment: Augmentin - provided temporary relief for about a month
    - When symptoms returned: Two-week course of combined antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin + Moxifloxacin) - led to complete relief for 4 weeks
    - When symptoms returned again: 5-day course of Zinnat - didn't resolve symptoms
  * Tonsil removal surgery: Mid-July 2024
  * Recovery period: No symptoms from July to October 2024

### Third Episode (Fall 2024 - Present)
- Duration: October 2024 - Present (ongoing for over 1 year)
- Second heart inflammation (subacute myocarditis) diagnosis: January 2025
  * Mild presentation with similar pattern to first episode
  * Ejection fraction initially 48%, improved to 60%
  * Developed gradually over about a month before clear symptoms
- Initially showed some improvement with walking and stress reduction, but developed into an ongoing episode
- Treatment attempt with Azithromycin (October 2024):
  * 6-day course after 30 days of sore throat
  * Only partial improvement (about 50% better) while taking it
  * Symptoms returned to previous level after stopping
- Treatment after second heart inflammation diagnosis:
  * Moxifloxacin for 16 days
  * Quick improvement in first 2-10 days with complete symptom relief
  * Symptoms returned and worsened on day 11
  * Continued worsening until end of treatment course


## Chronic Pain Amplification Pattern - 10 Year History

Analysis of a potential central sensitization/pain amplification syndrome manifesting across multiple body systems over the past decade:

### 1. Alcohol-Triggered Urinary/Pelvic Pain (10 years ago - present)
- **Prior baseline**: No urinary/pelvic symptoms
- **Onset**: Gradual over 1 year (mild discomfort → severe pain)
- **Progression**: Started mild, progressively worsened to current state
- **Current state**: Even 0.3% alcohol (non-alcoholic beer) triggers burning urination and pelvic pain lasting hours to days
- **Diagnosis**: Prostatitis (but multiple ultrasounds show no structural issues)
- **Stress trigger**: Significant stress/tension(like I'm getting very tense down THERE) can trigger same pain for several days (less severe than alcohol)

### 2. Persistent Daily Headache (4-5 year period)
- **Prior baseline**: 2-4 headaches per month throughout life
- **Onset**: Acute - one day became constant
- **Duration**: Nearly constant for 4-5 years
- **Pattern change**: Episodic → chronic overnight

### 3. Chronic Back Pain from Minor Trauma (4 years ago - present)
- **Prior baseline**: No back issues
- **Onset**: Acute from minor trauma (jumping from 0.5m)
- **Acute phase**: 4 months severe pain affecting sleep/lying down
- **Current**: Mostly resolved but triggers remain (bending, tension, minor impacts)
- **Stress recurrence**: Moderate-significant psysical stressor brings back symptoms for 1-2 weeks at lower severity, then complete resolution

### 4. Widespread Pain/Fibromyalgia (4 years ago)
- **Timing**: Started 3 months after back pain began (during acute back pain episode)
- **Likely trigger**: Back pain + month of no sleep + stress
- **Onset**: Rapid development over weeks
- **Characteristics**: Mild but widespread pain (muscles, joints, face, jaw)
- **Initial duration**: 3-4 months then completely resolved
- **Stress recurrence**: Moderate-significant psycological stress(like I'm getting very tense) brings back symptoms for 1-2 weeks at lower severity, then complete resolution

### Pattern Analysis:

**Onset Patterns:**
- **Gradual**: Alcohol sensitivity (1 year progression)
- **Acute transformation of baseline**: Headaches (episodic → constant)
- **Acute from trigger**: Back pain (trauma), Widespread pain (back pain + stress)

**Prior Symptoms:**
- **No baseline**: Alcohol/pelvic, back pain
- **Some baseline**: Headaches (2-4/month)
- **Secondary to another condition**: Widespread pain (followed back pain)

**Common Features:**
1. **Stress as reactivation trigger**: All conditions worsen or return with stress/tension
2. **Resolution patterns vary**: Some permanent (alcohol), some episodic (widespread pain), some chronic (headaches)
3. **Disproportionate response**: Minor triggers → major/prolonged symptoms
4. **No structural damage**: Testing shows no tissue damage to explain symptoms
5. **Stress-return pattern**: Back and widespread pain return for 1-2 weeks with stress at lower severity

### Potential Connection to Current Throat/Cardiac Condition:
The current inflammatory episodes may represent another manifestation of this amplification pattern:
- **Prior baseline**: Chronic tonsillitis that resolved normally (may have had some right-sided pain, unclear)
- **Onset**: Acute transformation (December 2022)
- **Key feature**: Right-sided throat/neck pain is the most consistent starting point of episodes
- **Pattern change**: Normal recovery → chronic episodes that won't resolve
- **Stress relationship**: Episodes triggered/worsened by stress
- **Disproportionate response**: 
  * Excessive local inflammation that persists
  * Likely inadequate/dysregulated immune response
- **Similar to**: Headache pattern (baseline condition that suddenly became chronic)

This suggests possible:
- Central sensitization syndrome with varied manifestations
- Neuroimmune dysregulation causing both excessive inflammation AND inadequate immune clearance
- Stress-induced inflammatory amplification
- Progressive sensitization over decade (each condition potentially priming for next)
- Current state represents vulnerability where minor triggers cause major downstream effects

## Pre-existing Conditions
Prior to the current condition's onset in December 2022, there was a history of chronic tonsillopharyngitis with typical presentations and resolutions (approximately one week duration). Multiple throat cultures were performed over the years, consistently showing:

Additional chronic conditions:
- History of psychosomatic manifestations:
  * **Insomnia**: Since teenage years
  * **Chronic headache**: 4-year continuous headache in past
  * **Widespread pain**: Body-wide muscle/joint pain (3 months, 4 years ago), recurs with stress
  * **Abdominal issues**: Weeks-long pain/nausea following stress, diagnosed with IBS
  * **Stomach reactions**: Feel sick in stomach after acute stress
- Intermittent joint pain:
  * Duration: Variable (days to weeks)
  * Location: Primarily elbows and knees, occasionally hands
  * Characteristics: No visible swelling
- Recurring muscle pain
- Ophthalmological conditions:
  * Glaucoma
  * High myopia
- Gastrointestinal:
  * IBS
  * Chronically low appetite
  * No appetite in mornings
  * Poor tolerance to fruits
- Body composition:
  * Consistently low BMI throughout life
- ENT conditions:
  * Deviated nasal septum (J34.2)
  * Tonsillectomy (July 2024)
- Mental health:
  * Long-term low-grade depression

## Cardiac MRI Timeline & Analysis

* **March 13, 2024**: Subacute focal myocarditis (EF 53%), positive T2 imaging (ratio >2.0), pericardial effusion (6mm), meeting 2 Lake Louise criteria.

* **May 29, 2024**: Resolution of active myocarditis with improved EF (56%), normal T2 values, residual chronic pericarditis with mild inflammation in segment 5.

* **July 10, 2024**: Continued improvement with normal cardiac function, reduced pericardial edema, normal T1/T2 values, thin pericardial effusion (3mm).

* **October 7, 2024**: Stable cardiac status, mild myocardial fibrosis, minimal pericardial changes, normal EF (56%).

* **January 21, 2025**: Second myocarditis episode with reduced EF (46%), positive T2 imaging (>2.0), bilateral pleural effusions, and left atrial fibrosis (Utah stage 1).

* **March 17, 2025**: Recovery with normalized EF (60%), no active inflammation, but multiple residual fibrotic changes in segments 2, 8, 6, 10 and posterior interventricular groove.

### Key Observations:

* **Pattern**: Both episodes follow a consistent progression from subacute myocarditis to chronic pericarditis within approximately 2 months.

* **EF Recovery**: EF normalizes to 60%+ within 2–3 months after each flare, with preserved mechanics on serial echocardiograms (no progressive cardiomyopathy).

* **Fibrosis Progression**: Fibrotic changes show a gradual increase over time, with initial involvement primarily in subepicardial regions, later progressing to more widespread intramyocardial patterns and eventually involving the atria (by January 2025). The distribution suggests non-ischemic etiology consistent with post-inflammatory changes.

* **Inflammation Pattern**: Both episodes demonstrate predominant involvement of lateral and septal walls, with inflammation following a subepicardial-to-mesocardial distribution typical for immune-mediated myocarditis.

   - Normal barrier function indicated


## Echocardiography & Rhythm Monitoring

### Echocardiograms (2021–2025)

## Laboratory Findings and Disease Patterns

### Recent Immunological Findings (Feb–Oct 2025)

**Data included:** six longitudinal lymphocyte-subset panels (Feb–Oct 2025) + Synevo immunology (Mar 3, 2025) + prior immune/cytokine workups.

#### 1) Longitudinal blood cell counts (Feb–Oct 2025)

* **Leukocytes (WBC):** cyclical mild leukopenia, typically 2.68–3.30×10⁹/L during lower points with intermittent normalization up to 4.67×10⁹/L. Absolute lymphocytes remain low-normal (0.95–1.92×10⁹/L).
  *(six serial panels)*

#### 2) T-cell compartment

* **Total T cells (CD3+):** high-normal proportion across timepoints.
  *(six serial panels)*
* **CD4/CD8 balance:** persistent **T-helper predominance** with CD4/CD8 typically >2 (range ~2.13–3.19). Absolute **CD8+ T cells are low** throughout (≈0.19–0.30×10⁹/L).
  *(six serial panels)*
* **Activation markers:** transient spikes mid-summer (e.g., CD8+ HLA-DR+) with otherwise subdued activation baselines, consistent with **brief immune “micro-flares” on a low-activation background**.
  *(six serial panels)*

#### 3) B-cell compartment

* **Naïve vs memory:** persistent **shift toward memory B cells** with **reduced naïve B2 cells** across all six measurements (memory mostly elevated; naïve mostly below the lab reference). This reproduces the Feb–Mar 2025 pattern described earlier.

#### 4) NK-cell compartment

* **Counts/phenotype:** absolute NK counts hover low-normal; **activation fraction is chronically low**, while the **cytolytic (CD16^bright/CD56^dim) phenotype is very high**—a stable functional skew replicated across measurements.

#### 5) Soluble inflammatory markers (Mar 2025 snapshot)

* **Cytokines:** IL-6 2.91 pg/mL (normal), IL-1β <2 pg/mL (normal); TNF-α low-normal. **hsCRP <0.15 mg/L**. Overall panel **does not indicate systemic cytokine activation** despite symptoms.
* **ESR** in that period was low (contextually consistent with low CRP/cytokines).

#### 6) Humoral immunity & complement (Mar 2025)

* **Immunoglobulins:** IgG 10.19 g/L, IgA 2.06 g/L, IgM 0.95 g/L—**within reference**; total IgE 6.79 (low).
* **Complement:** C3 0.91 g/L and C4 0.10 g/L—**within lab reference** for adults.

#### 7) Autoimmunity & specific antibody panels

* **ANA:** borderline/weak positive by IFT (1:100) in 2024 and again Mar 2025; **concurrent ANA screening (ELiA) negative (index 0.3)**; **AMA negative**—overall **no specific CTD autoantibody pattern**.
* **Cardiac/neuromuscular autoimmunity & myositis panels:** negative (myocardial, myolemmal, Ca-channel; extended myositis Ab panel).
* **Immune function assays:** phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation **normal**, arguing against global immune failure; dysregulation likely at **regulatory/network** level.

#### 8) Histamine/mast-cell–adjacent markers (Mar 2025)

* **Diamine oxidase (DAO):** 10.72 → **“low degree” of histamine intolerance** per lab rubric; does not point to clinically significant histamine intolerance.
* **Tryptase:** not elevated; no evidence here for systemic mast-cell activation (value within reference in the same Synevo set).

#### 9) Virology & immune exposure context

* Past exposures without active replication/reactivation on comprehensive panels (EBV, CMV, etc.). These help **exclude ongoing classic viral reactivation** as the driver of current immune phenotype.

#### Summary pattern (what this likely means for your case)

* The **architecture of the immune system is intact** (normal IgG/A/M, complement, normal basic cell functions), **without systemic inflammatory cytokine signature** or disease-defining autoantibodies.
* Superimposed on that is a **stable regulatory imbalance** that keeps recurring across months:

  1. **T-helper > T-cytotoxic bias** with **low CD8 absolute counts**,
  2. **B-cell maturation skew** (↓ naïve, ↑ memory),
  3. **NK functional skew** (↑ cytolytic phenotype with **low activation**).
     Together with persistent mild leukopenia, this pattern reads as **chronic dysregulation/exhaustion with episodic micro-activation**, not classic high-grade inflammation or frank autoimmunity.

### Blood Parameters Analysis (2018-2025)

Analysis of 20+ blood tests from 2018-2025 reveals several significant patterns:

1. WBC (White Blood Cell) Patterns:
   * **Recurrent leukopenia** (low WBC counts <3.9 G/L) observed in multiple tests: Dec 2018, Mar 2024, Jun 2024, Nov 2024, Dec 2024, Feb 2025
   * WBC typically runs at the lower end of normal or below normal
   * These findings suggest that low WBC counts have been a recurring issue predating the current condition

2. Neutrophil Patterns:
   * Low neutrophils in Dec 2018 (0.86 G/L) and Feb 2025 (1.44 G/L)
   * Despite low WBC counts, neutrophil percentages generally remain in normal range

3. Lymphocyte Patterns:
   * Generally normal counts, with relative lymphocytosis during low WBC periods (which is expected)

4. Inflammation Markers:
   * **CRP consistently normal** (<1.0 mg/L) in most measurements
   * **ESR elevated** during specific periods:
     - Mar 2024 (22 mm/h) 
     - Jun 2024 (12 mm/h)

5. Other Significant Findings:
   * **Monocytosis** (>9.5%) in several tests: Dec 2018, Mar 2024, Oct 2024, Feb 2025

6. Key Observations:
   * Blood work shows a pattern of **cyclical changes** that align with the described throat inflammation episodes

   * Notable exception: November 2023 showed a significant inflammatory response with:
     - Elevated WBC (8.90 G/L)
     - High neutrophils (7.74 G/L, 87%)
     - Low lymphocytes (0.45 G/L, 5%)
     - Zero eosinophils
     - Elevated CRP (51.3 mg/L)
     - Elevated ESR (14 mm/h)

2. Persistent Bilirubin Elevation:
   * November 2020: Total bilirubin 26.0 μmol/L (normal: 5-21)
   * Direct bilirubin 4.1 μmol/L (normal: 0-3.4)
   * March 2019: Similar elevated bilirubin values
   * Pattern suggests ongoing mild liver function changes or Gilbert's syndrome

3. Autoimmune Markers (2018):
   * Rheumatoid factor: Normal (9.4 IU/ml, normal <14)
   * Anti-streptolysin O: Normal (191 IU/ml, normal <200)
   * Anti-citrullinated vimentin: Normal (13.9 IU/ml, normal <20)
   * Testing for celiac disease markers negative

4. Lipid Profile (2018):
   * Slightly elevated cholesterol (5.15 mmol/L, normal <5)
   * Otherwise normal lipid pattern
   
These historical tests demonstrate that both the WBC fluctuations and bilirubin elevations likely predate the onset of the current inflammatory condition, suggesting possible underlying metabolic or immune system irregularities that may have existed for years before the current symptoms developed.

### Rheumatological Findings Summary

CRP has consistently remained low across all measurements (<0.6 mg/L).

Key findings chronologically:

- ASLO: 214 IU/mL (ref: <200) - slightly elevated

### Viral Studies Timeline

Recent Comprehensive Viral Panel (November 2024):
- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) testing revealed:
  * VCA IgM negative (0.5)
  * VCA IgG positive (16.4)
  * EBNA IgG strongly positive (>100.00)
  * EBV DNA PCR negative
  This pattern indicates past infection without current reactivation

- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing showed:
  * IgG positive (21.38)
  * IgM negative (0.34)
  * CMV DNA PCR negative
  Similarly suggesting past exposure without current activity

- Additional viral testing:
  * HSV 1/2 IgG negative
  * HHV-6 DNA PCR negative
  * HHV-7 DNA PCR negative
  * HIV negative (Summer 2023)

Historical Viral Studies (2021):
- EBV serology showed established immunity:
  * VCA IgG positive (91.41)
  * EBNA-1 IgG positive (10.53)
- CMV showed strong past exposure:
  * IgG strongly positive (>500 U/mL)
  
Yersinia (March 2024)
- Yersinia enterocolitica IgG: 13.45 U/ml (<18)
- Yersinia spp specific antigens:
    * p38 (LorV) positive
    * p46 (YopM) borderline
    * Other antigens negative

### Lyme Disease Investigation (2021)

Testing showed inconclusive results:
- IgM borderline with:
  * OspC borderline results
  * Overall pattern inconclusive
- IgG largely negative except:
  * p41 positive
  * Other markers negative
- Pattern did not meet diagnostic criteria for active Lyme disease

### Immune System Dysregulation Patterns

Recent findings suggest a complex pattern of immune system changes:

1. Immune Cell Balance:
   * Persistent low white blood cell count
   * Altered T-cell activation patterns
   * Imbalance in B-cell populations (low naive cells, high memory cells)
   * Changes in NK-cell function

2. Inflammation Control:
   * Consistently low inflammatory markers despite symptoms
   * Normal complement system function
   * No evidence of autoimmune markers
   * Normal immune complex levels

3. Notable Patterns:
   * Signs of chronic immune activation (high memory B-cells)
   * Reduced immune surveillance (low NK-cell activation)
   * Possible immune exhaustion pattern
   * Preserved overall immune system architecture despite irregularities

These findings suggest an ongoing immune system disruption that might explain:
- Recurring inflammation episodes
- Unusual response to infections
- Variable treatment effectiveness
- Tendency for symptom persistence

### Microbiology and PCR Studies

Nasopharyngeal PCR Testing (All Negative):
- Respiratory pathogens:
  * Streptococcus pneumoniae
  * Mycoplasma pneumoniae
  * Haemophilus influenzae
  * Bordetella pertussis
  * Bordetella parapertussis 
  * Chlamydophila pneumoniae
  * Legionella pneumophila
  * (Analytical sensitivity: 4000 copies/ml)

Oropharyngeal Sampling (All Negative):
- Chlamydia trachomatis (Analytical sensitivity: 75 copies/ml)
- Mycoplasma genitalium

Bacterial Throat Culture Findings (see earlier sections):
- Consistent presence of Streptococcus spp at high loads (10^6 CFU/sample)
- Various other common respiratory tract bacteria present at lower concentrations
- Most recent cultures (2025) showed:
  * Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10^4 CFU)
  * Streptococcus mitis (10^6 CFU)

The negative PCR results for multiple bacterial pathogens help rule out several specific infectious causes, particularly those associated with atypical pneumonia and other respiratory infections that might have cardiac complications. This aligns with specialists' assessments that the myocarditis does not appear to be typical bacterial in origin.

  * Escherichia coli (<10^3 CFU)
  * Acinetobacter baumannii (10^3 CFU)
  * Enterococcus faecalis (10^4 CFU)
  * Staphylococcus aureus (10^3 CFU)

### Recent Endoscopic Findings (February 2025)

Endoscopy revealed several significant findings:

1. Esophageal Status:
- Normal esophageal passage and function
- Z-line location and appearance suggests no major structural issues
- Proper hiatal closure

2. Gastric Changes:
- Presence of concentrated green bile in stomach
- Reduced stomach motility (weak peristalsis)
- Diffuse inflammation of stomach lining (erythematous gastropathy)
- Negative for H. pylori infection

3. Other Observations:
- Normal duodenum with minor lymphatic vessel changes
- No active bile reflux at pylorus
- Grade 1 cardial fold condition

These findings provide objective evidence of:
- Active gastric inflammation
- Potential motility issues
- Bile presence that might contribute to symptoms
- No structural abnormalities that would fully explain symptoms

### Gallbladder and Bile Issues

Progression Over Time:

2017 Findings:
- Gallbladder with bends in body and neck area
- Small suspended particles in gallbladder
- No stones or additional formations
- Mild bile stasis
- Normal bile duct size

Historical Bilirubin Elevations:
- Multiple instances of elevated total and direct bilirubin dating back to at least 2019-2020
- November 2020: Total bilirubin 26.0 μmol/L (normal: 5-21), direct bilirubin 4.1 μmol/L (normal: 0-3.4)
- Pattern suggests possible Gilbert's syndrome or chronic mild cholestasis

2025 Findings:
- Gallbladder normal size (7.8 x 2.5 cm)
- Multiple bends in body, lower third, and neck
- Non-homogeneous content
- At least 4 elevated echogenic formations (up to 0.46 cm) that:
  * Don't cast acoustic shadows
  * Don't move with position changes
- Small liver hemangioma noted

Clinical Significance:
- Progressive changes in gallbladder structure over 7 years
- Development of new formations
- Long history of mild bilirubin elevations
- Possible connection to:
  * Recent GERD symptoms
  * Food intolerances
  * Current inflammatory condition

## Characteristic Symptom Patterns and Treatment Responses

### Episode Pattern and Phases
Based on the third episode observations:

Initial Trigger:
- Starts with a strobing or pulsing type of pain under the chin
- Different from typical sore throat - more similar to neck pain
- Usually noticed upon waking

Three Distinct Phases:

1. Acute Phase:
- Can develop rapidly (within 1 hour) from mild symptoms
- Whole throat pain (more intense on right side)
- Fever (37-37.4°C)
- Significant fatigue and malaise
- Feels similar to common cold
- Doctors observe significant throat redness
- Duration: typically 5-7 days

Additional Symptoms (occur occasionally):
- Runny nose in about 20-30% of acute phases
  * Usually mild
  * Only two instances of significant nasal discharge similar to a cold
  * Many acute phases had no nasal symptoms at all
- Cough (rare)
  * Few instances of feeling the need to cough
  * One or two episodes with productive cough (brown discharge)
  * These additional respiratory symptoms are exceptions rather than typical
- Overall pattern remains primarily sore throat and fatigue

2. Mild Phase:
- Mild sore throat
- Occasional chills
- Light fatigue
- Very localized discomfort on right side of throat
- Sometimes additional areas of discomfort
- ENTs may or may not observe mild redness

3. Minimal Symptoms Phase:
- Almost no symptoms
- May still have slight throat discomfort

Pattern Variations:
- Third Episode: Mostly alternates between mild and minimal phases, with occasional acute flares
- First Episode: ~4 weeks of nearly constant acute phase
- Second Episode: Multiple acute/mild phases initially controlled through walking/exercise
- Post-heart inflammation period: Predominantly mild phases with some acute episodes

Key Characteristics:
- Rapid phase changes possible (mild to acute in less than 1 hour)
- Right-sided throat discomfort persists through mild phases
- Throat pain quality differs from typical cold/flu, especially on right side
- Blood tests show decreasing white cell counts during episodes
- Normal inflammation markers despite symptoms
- Risk of heart complications after prolonged inflammation

## Reflux/Anti-reflux Treatment Timeline and Observations

### Historical Context
1. **8 years ago**: Gastroscopy found reflux esophagitis
   - Had NO reflux symptoms (no heartburn)
   - Presenting symptoms were nausea/abdominal pain
   - Could eat absolutely everything without issues

2. **Pre-6-12 months ago**: No heartburn history
   - Could eat anything, any time
   - No dietary restrictions needed

### Evolution During Episodes

**Second Episode (Fall 2023 - Summer 2024):**
- Started suspecting reflux connection due to:
  * Mild esophageal irritation
  * Recalled old reflux diagnosis
  * Found literature describing reflux as cause of unexplained chronic throat pain
  * Noticed correlation: overeating before bed → worse symptoms next day

**Third Episode (Fall 2024 - Present):**
- Started aggressive anti-reflux treatment:
  * Different PPIs (esomeprazole)
  * Gaviscon
  * Famotidine
  * Sucralfate (1-2 weeks, 3x daily - didn't work)

### Paradoxical Worsening with Treatment
**TLDR: Anti-reflux medications made situation worse overall**
- Food tolerance significantly decreased
- Now require strict diet (can't eat spicy/sweet/coffee)
- Developed REAL heartburn for first time (though mild and infrequent)
- Started 6-12 months ago - first heartburn in life

### Current Dilemma
- Attempted to taper esomeprazole and famotidine
- Mostly goes well until:
  * Feel sour in mouth
  * Have flare
  * Feel worse next day
  * Resume medications due to misery
- Considering 24-hour pH test (expecting minimal reflux) to justify tapering

### Clear Food-Symptom Connection (99% confident)
**Trigger reliability:**
- Overeating: 90% → flare
- Eating then burping: 80-90% → symptoms
- Spicy food: 70-80% → next day flare
- Pattern: Too full OR bad food = flare

### Potential Positive Effect
- First episode: 4 weeks constant systemic symptoms
- Current (third) episode: Systemic symptoms only 20-30% of the time
- Suggests diet may be helping despite other issues

### GERD and Symptoms Relationship

Endoscopic and Ultrasound Evidence (February 2025):
- Active stomach inflammation without H. pylori infection
- Presence of bile and reduced stomach motility
- Normal esophageal structure but signs of gastric dysfunction
- Gallbladder changes and bile issues possibly contributing to symptoms

Historical Context:
- No history of heartburn before last 12 months
- Could eat freely, including late meals, without issues
- Rare episodes of chest discomfort (burning/throbbing) in previous years

Recent Changes (Last 2-3 months):
- Frequent heartburn (every other day)
- Burning sensation in lower esophagus, near stomach, often after eating
- First time experiencing regular heartburn symptoms
- First time experiencing "very bitter taste in mouth" (after desert)

Esophageal Symptoms During Episodes:
- Two distinct types of discomfort:
  * Classic heartburn: burning, pulsating sensation closer to stomach
  * Different sensation: more like soreness, feeling like an extension of sore throat
- During 2nd and 3rd episodes, experienced soreness in esophagus similar to throat symptoms

Food and Symptom Triggers:
1. Clear Acute Phase Triggers:
   * Episode after chocolate during walk (autumn): symptoms in 30-60 minutes
   * Episode after spinach pie during antibiotic treatment: symptoms in 15 minutes, ENT confirmed mild redness

2. Observed Patterns (not 100% consistent):
   * Quick Response:
     - Black tea and coffee seem to worsen throat discomfort (80% confidence)
     - Clear timing: sometimes mid-day reaction, ruling out morning irritation
   * Delayed Response:
     - Sweet foods, cakes, pies appear to worsen symptoms
     - Chocolate noticed to affect symptoms 6-12 months ago
   * General Triggers:
     - Overeating appears to worsen symptoms (recent observation)
     - Night-time eating/drinking seems to affect morning symptoms

Treatment Response:
1. Current Management (2-3 months):
   * Strict diet
   * PPIs (Nexium 40mg 1-2 times daily)
   * Gaviscon
   * Elevated head position
   * No lying down after eating
   * Results: Modest improvement (20-50% better)

2. Individual Treatments:
   * Gaviscon:
     - Sometimes provides immediate throat relief (possibly due to menthol)
     - Effective for heartburn symptoms
   * PPIs:
     - Limited clear benefit
     - No noticeable change when medication stopped
     - More strict regime last 2 months without significant improvement

Night-time Patterns:
- Avoiding food/drink before bed seems helpful
- One notable incident: woke without symptoms, drank water, slept one hour, woke with sore throat
- LPR-like symptoms after one episode:
  * Morning sore throat (resolving within ~1 hour)
  * Morning voice hoarseness

## Throat Pain Characteristics

The throat/neck discomfort has several distinct patterns:

1. Primary Symptoms:
   * **Localized "itching"** sensation primarily on the right side of the neck under the jaw (salivary gland region), sometimes extending down the neck toward the chest
   * This itching is often the only symptom and causes minimal discomfort
   * No apparent triggers, often apears on its own, sometimes after meals, sometimes after morning hydration (drinking water)
   * More noticeable when gargling but doesn't impact normal swallowing
   * Fluctuates in intensity and may spontaneously resolve

2. Secondary Pain Pattern:
   * Food-triggered discomfort in the upper palate
   * Slight discomfort when swallowing
   * Often follows coffee consumption or heartburn
   * Responds somewhat to Gaviscon (possibly due to menthol soothing effect)
   * Primarily right-sided when mild

3. Severe Episodes:
   * Throbbing pain in that area, on the right side of the neck under the jaw(this is rare, typically only at episode onset or during significant flares)
   * More widespread, symmetrical pain resembling a cold when fully developed
   * Sometimes accompanied by mild chills
   * Can progress to systemic symptoms (fatigue, general malaise)
