# Alternative Hypotheses & Treatment Directions (Working List)

> Scope: This is a living list of *my own* ideas/directions, now grouped by mechanism and priority.

---

## PRIORITY 1: Core nervous system dysregulation

**Working hypothesis:** Chronic ANS dysfunction is the primary driver; everything else may be downstream.

1. **Meditation (jhanas)**
   * Rationale: reliable relaxation/pleasant affect; safe container to notice and work with inner tensions.
   * Actions: continue practice; consider hiring a coach.
   * Status: **already doing; retreat completed; promising** ✓

2. **Taper benzodiazepines (гидазепам)**
   * Plan: gradual taper (4–6 months) vs. buffered faster with pregabalin (1–2 months minimum).
   * Rationale: masking baseline state; need to know what works without chemical override.
   * Status: **critical next step** - design schedule.

3. **Normal work/life balance**
   * Boundaries: no weekends, stop work after 19:00.
   * Pomodoro: timer + 15‑min relax breaks; brief tension‑release between cycles.
   * Status: already doing.

4. **Resonant breathing**
   * Note: already doing; calming.
   * Status: continue.

5. **Stretching / Mobility**
   * Rationale: body feels tense; address chronic muscular holding.
   * Actions: restart course with modifications; consider a coach; possibly add gym work.
   * Notes: paused due to back issues; course may not fully fit me.

6. **Regular massage**
   * Note: arrange seated sessions due to reflux.
   * Status: to schedule.

7. **Therapy / CBT**
   * Idea: structured work on patterns (tension, perfectionism/procrastination cycle, coping).
   * Status: consider starting/returning.

### Additional ANS/nervous system interventions (lower priority)

8. **Vagus nerve stimulation**
   * Cold face immersions: vagal/dive‑reflex stimulation
   * Devices: research non‑invasive VNS devices
   * Status: to research.

9. **Pain Reprocessing Therapy (PRT) for throat pain**
   * Idea: work with throat pain using pain reprocessing techniques; treat as learned neural pattern rather than tissue damage.
   * Rationale: chronic pain can become self-sustaining through neural sensitization; PRT addresses this directly.
   * Status: consider trial.

10. **Alternative psych therapies**
    * Items: Internal Family Systems, Ideal Parent Figure Protocol, Gendlin's Focusing, Enneagram, imaginal work.
    * Status: consider sampling.

10. **Daily high‑level principles list**
    * Idea: one‑page "how to live the day" (constitution/mantras), read each morning.
    * Status: to draft.

11. **Personal AI for therapy**
    * Idea: build/use an AI agent for therapeutic prompts/check‑ins.
    * Status: explore.

12. **Breathing exercises (various)**
    * Items: 4‑7‑8, etc.
    * Status: consider.

## PRIORITY 2: GI/Reflux axis (test hypothesis properly)

**Working hypothesis:** Reflux → throat irritation → immune activation. But need to *prove* reflux exists first.

13. **24-hour pH monitoring FIRST**
    * Action: do 24‑hour pH (± impedance) monitoring.
    * Rationale: **stop guessing**; if minimal reflux, entire axis deprioritized.
    * Status: **to schedule immediately**.

### IF reflux confirmed, then:

14. **Reduce anti‑reflux meds (if pH shows minimal reflux)**
    * Action: taper esomeprazole/famotidine.
    * Status: pending pH test results.

15. **Prokinetics — proper trial**
    * Idea: repeat with correct timing (30 min pre‑meal) and adequate duration; track.
    * Candidates: domperidone, itopride, prucalopride (pick one, do it right).
    * Status: plan trial if reflux confirmed.

16. **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)**
    * Idea: bile/GERD/gallbladder axis experiment.
    * Status: consider trial if reflux/bile component confirmed.

17. **Psyllium husk**
    * Idea: fiber for GI/bile/GERD angle and stool regularity.
    * Status: low-risk trial, can start anytime.

### Food strategy (pick ONE direction):

18. **Food re‑introduction (default plan)**
    * Idea: stop over‑restriction; gradual reintroduction to reverse intolerance sensitization while watching flares.
    * Status: plan protocol.

19. **Very strict elimination diet (alternative - short trial only)**
    * Plan: rice + chicken (or similar simple menu) to probe food‑intolerance angle.
    * Duration: 2-3 weeks max, then evaluate.
    * Status: **conflicts with #18** - choose one approach.

## PRIORITY 3: Immune modulation

**Working hypothesis:** Dysregulated immune response; need to modulate rather than suppress.

20. **Immune modulators (order 1–2)**
    * Candidates to shortlist: Imunorix, Thymosin‑α1.
    * Status: planning stage - pick 1-2 max, trial sequentially.

21. **Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN)**
    * Status: **ongoing trial at 4.5mg** - give it proper time (2-3 months).

22. **Hydroxychloroquine**
    * Idea: disease‑modifying/immune‑modulating experiment.
    * Status: idea only - later if others fail.

23. **Oral probiotic K12 course**
    * Idea: throat microbiome modulation.
    * Status: consider course.

## PRIORITY 4: Symptomatic relief & quality of life

**Working hypothesis:** Less suffering → less stress → less flares. Direct benefit even if not addressing root cause.

24. **Symptom relief as upstream benefit**
    * Current: paracetamol/anti‑cold sachets (2–6/day).
    * Rationale: less throat irritation might reduce immune activation; better mood helps.
    * Status: **already doing** - continue and monitor.

25. **Antihistamines trial**
    * Note: cetirizine tried ~1 week (no clear effect); currently on famotidine.
    * Status: consider structured trial/alternatives (but famotidine already in stack).

---

## PRIORITY 5: Supplements & supportive agents

**Working hypothesis:** May help at margins; low-risk trials.

26. **Alpha‑lipoic acid**
    * Idea: antioxidant/neuropathic pain angle.
    * Status: consider trial.

27. **Zinc / Selenium**
    * Idea: supplement trial.
    * Status: consider.

28. **Taurine**
    * Idea: supplement trial.
    * Status: consider.

29. **Ashwagandha**
    * Idea: adaptogen trial.
    * Status: consider.

## PRIORITY 6: Medications for ANS/mood (exploratory)

**Working hypothesis:** Might help nervous system regulation, but most are shots in the dark.

30. **Propranolol**
    * Idea: anxiety/ANS modulation.
    * Status: undecided.

31. **Guanfacine**
    * Idea: ANS/attention modulation.
    * Status: undecided.

32. **Pregabalin — further trial?**
    * Idea: revisit dosing/parameters.
    * Status: undecided - currently at 75mg x2, was at 150mg x2.

33. **Gabapentin(e)?**
    * Idea: consider alongside/versus pregabalin.
    * Status: undecided.

### Mood boosters / nootropics (low confidence)

34. **Semax / Selank**
    * Items: Semax (stimulatory), Selank (anxiolytic).
    * Prior: GB-115 tried short time — no effect.
    * Status: keep as options if desperate.

35. **Other nootropics**
    * Items: agmatine sulfate (?), ALCAR (?).
    * Prior tried: bromantane (no effect), phenylpiracetam (no effect).
    * Status: list for consideration, low priority.

36. **Pramipexole**
    * Idea: consider exploratory trial.
    * Status: undecided - very experimental.

## DEPRIORITIZED / LOGGED

37. **HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen)**
    * Note: concern about glaucoma — evaluate safety/contraindications.
    * Status: idea only, safety concerns.

38. **Cold showers**
    * Note: previously seemed to slightly worsen throat pain.
    * Status: cautious - probably skip.

39. **Desensitization (capsaicin)**
    * Idea: graded exposure using pepper/capsaicin; monitor effects.
    * Status: experimental idea, very low priority.

40. **Tianeptine**
    * Note: brief trial a couple of years ago; no improvement.
    * Status: logged as previously tried; no current plan.

41. **Inosine‑pranobex**
    * Note: tried; no improvement.
    * Status: logged as failed.

---

## ONGOING INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

42. **Anecdote mining (reddit etc.)**
    * Action: read communities overlapping with CFS/fibro/GERD/LPR/myocarditis for idea harvesting.
    * Status: ongoing.
