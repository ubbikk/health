1. Long walking doesn't work anymore. It happened gradually, worked 2.5 years ago, worked 1.5 year ago but needed more and relapses happened. Barelly worked 6 month ago. Same for cardio/gym
2. Is moderate cardio beneficial or dangerous? Very important question: I feel better overall, my mood is better, quality of life as well, maybe immunomodulating. On the other hand strain on heart sort of makes myocarditis reocurrence more likely? Unclear
3. I need to tapper down benzos. Probably very gradually during 4-6 months? Maybe faster using some buffer agent or increasing pregabalin, but still 1-2 months
4. I need to cut down anti-reflux shit. Now it's a mess. Need to do this fucking 24h ph monitoring prior probably
5. By trying to limit reflux via strict diet I probably got some intolerance to most foods. Probably need to bite the bullet and try gradually reintroducing
6. Some hope that by gradualy making mood better this shit also could get better. Probably main focus should be on this.
7. Antidepresants don't work for me
8. Need to read reddit for similar conditions, fibromialgia/cfs etc. maybe will found some ideas
9. Maybe symptomatic relief could have direct benefit. For instance paracetamol, less pain, less irritation in throat, less immune reaction. Let alone better mood.
10. morning HRV does correlate with flare/severity but sometimes it shows I'm 10/10 and i'm like shit and otherwise it shows low number but i'm more or less well
11. Not drinking water during the night(as I used to) seems to help
12. Sometimes I feel bad taste in the mouse when wake up at night. Sometimes sour taste, for instance when tried to stop esomeprasol. Only a couple of times very bitter taste
13. I tried to tapper down benzos, 40mg-30mg-25mg-20mg every 3-5 days this summer. My symptoms were getting worse and at the end i ended up with fever 38C, bacterial sinusitis which they I had to treat with antibiotics. Before that I used gidazepam often for short periods and was able to stop without problems. Maybe I just didn't notice my main symptoms worsened. Anyway that's why I'm stuck on benzos, will stay on them until complete the escitalopram trial
14. And benzos stopped working quickly, that's why i wanted to tapper down. So some fucking downregulation
15. Maybe to try anti-bile shit again + some prokinetics + maybe something against constipation?
