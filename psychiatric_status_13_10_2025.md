# Psychiatric and Psychological Profile

## Document Status
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025  
**Coverage Period:** December 2021 - October 2025  
**Note:** This document represents the psychological and psychiatric situation as of the last update date.

## Primary Goal: Prevent Further Cardiac Damage
Currently experiencing third myocarditis episode (ongoing over 1 year). Need to break the stress-inflammation cycle before more cardiac complications occur.

## Current Medical Situation
- Third major inflammatory episode since December 2022 (ongoing over 1 year)
- Two confirmed myocarditis episodes (March 2024, January 2025)
- Chronic throat inflammation that won't resolve
- Episodes last months at a time
- Symptoms worsen in cold weather
- EF currently normal but on lower end

## Core Psychological Patterns

### Chronic Tension/Activation State
**Not classic anxiety** - it's a nervous system stuck in "GO" mode unable to calm down:

**Baseline State:**
- Constant body tension "always to some extent" - lifelong pattern
- Tension primarily held in hands/legs (not throat - that's inflammation)
- Generally pessimistic outlook (not consciously threat-detecting, more due to lack of joy/happiness/fatigue)
- Baseline discomfort so persistent I use escape patterns constantly

**Tension Triggers & Escalation:**
1. **Work frustration**: Debugging issues cause near-instant escalation (seconds): "ok, ok, not ok, not ok, AAAAA!" → typically push harder rather than step back
2. **Social situations**: Even benign interactions (cafe, strangers) create tension
3. **Environmental irritants**: People talking loudly, unexpected disruptions
4. **Self-imposed urgency**: Deadlines (even self-created) create internal pressure and physical tension
5. **Feeling trapped**: Thinking about obligations creates body tension and action urge without ability to discharge

**Real-Time Example (during this psychiatric documentation session):**
- Tension increased when AI got something wrong (even in helpful interaction)
- Tension from it being late and not finishing when subconsciously expected to
- Then meta-tension: feeling bad about creating unnecessary stress for myself
- Shows how tension layers build even in low-stakes situations

**High-Activation Episodes (100x tension):**
- Occurs after prolonged stress (10h work days, no weekends)
- Tension becomes self-sustaining, doesn't need triggers
- Wake up already tense
- This is when cardiac issues develop

**Critical Observation (2025):**
- Had TWO extended periods without overactivation:
  * Summer 2025: Nearly entire summer, minimal stress
  * October 2025: 2-week vacation, no devices, no work, meditation, gym, walking, reading
- **Despite these periods, the inflammatory episode did not resolve**
- Implications:
  * Either overactivation plays lesser role than initially thought
  * Or the condition has become self-perpetuating
  * Or the nervous system dysregulation persists even without acute stressors
  * Or the root cause is deeper than situational stress

### Hypothesized Root Mechanism

**Working Theory:**
The core of chronic tension may be **suppression/resistance to pain and discomfort** combined with **fear of pain/discomfort**, which are likely downstream effects of:
- Social phobia (lifelong pattern)
- Inability to feel fully safe
- Nervous system never learning to downregulate

**Pattern:**
Pain/discomfort → resistance/suppression → chronic tension → more pain/discomfort → cycle reinforces

This creates a feedback loop where:
1. Body experiences discomfort (physical or emotional)
2. Automatic resistance/tensing against the discomfort
3. Resistance itself creates more tension
4. Fear of discomfort maintains hypervigilance
5. Unable to relax because relaxing means feeling the discomfort fully
6. Nervous system remains in defensive "GO" mode

### Escape & Distraction Patterns

**Primary Pattern:** Feel discomfort → escape into head/Twitter/work
- Doom scrolling for hours seeking distraction from body/mind discomfort
- Never satisfied, stop only when exhausted or feeling sick from the behavior
- 10/90 ratio: 10% attention to external world, 90% thinking

**Work as Escape:**
- Can work many days straight when hyperfocused on the task
- Or do nothing for months when procrastinating
- Both extremes are escape mechanisms

### Work Patterns: Procrastination-Perfectionism Cycle

**Procrastination Phase:**
- Can last months before starting projects
- Massive resistance to beginning
- Rumination about the work without doing it

**Transformation to "Video Game Mode":**
- Once started, could become unstoppable hyperfocus
- When work feels good, it just feels good - genuinely enjoyable
- Perfectionism kicks in: "I can do even better and they will see!"
- Usually happens late at night
- Sweet spot: After solving unknowns and having clear implementation path

**Work Intensity:**
- Occasionally work couple weeks without weekends (not extreme but happens)
- More typically: irregular patterns of intense work followed by low activity

**Energy Management:**
- Feel drained after eating (skip breakfast, late lunch)
- Best energy: cardio + coffee + heavy music (1-3 hours feeling alive)
- Rarely work more than 4-6 hours sustainably
- Two remote jobs, both "difficult shit, Dima will solve it" roles

## Psychosomatic Manifestations

### Current Evidence of Stress-Body Connection:
1. **Stress triggers**: Each episode started during prolonged stress periods
2. **Walking helps**: Long walks help stop episodes (passive rest doesn't)
3. **Benzodiazepines effective**: Гидазепам consistently improves symptoms
4. **Reflux connection**: Throat inflammation worsens with stress-related reflux
5. **Immediate stress response**: Muscle/joint pain worsen immediately after acute stress

### Historical Psychosomatic Patterns:
- **Insomnia**: Since teenage years
- **Chronic headache**: 4-year continuous headache in past
- **Widespread pain**: Body-wide muscle/joint pain (3 months, 4 years ago), recurs with stress
- **Abdominal issues**: Weeks-long pain/nausea following stress, diagnosed with IBS
- **Stomach reactions**: Feel sick in stomach after acute stress

## Psychological Background

### Dysthymia / Persistent Depressive Disorder (Lifelong):

**Terminology Clarification:**
What was previously called "low-grade depression" is more accurately **dysthymia** (Persistent Depressive Disorder) - a chronic, low-level depression that doesn't fully disable but creates a persistent grey baseline.

**Timeline:**
- Childhood: Shy, vulnerable, anxious temperament
- Age 13+: Grey baseline mood developed and persisted
- Present: Continues as baseline state

**Characteristics:**
- Mood usually low or neutral - "grey days, not bad, but nothing good really"
- Rarely experience genuine happiness or joy
- Constant background psychological discomfort
- Sense of "something missing" - a hole that needs filling
- Deep underlying sadness that never fully goes away
- **BUT mood IS reactive:** Responds to coffee, gym, physical state, circumstances
- **CAN experience pleasure** on better days, just not enough to fill the emptiness
- Function well enough (work, daily activities)
- Likely wouldn't score highly on standard depression questionnaires

**Pattern with Physical Illness:**
- Baseline dysthymia: 3-5/10 mood (depending on coffee/gym/physical state)
- During flares: Drops to 1/10 (dysthymia + situational depression from illness)
- When physically okay: Returns to baseline grey state
- This creates appearance of mood being entirely driven by physical symptoms, but the underlying dysthymia predates and persists independent of the current illness

**Critical Distinction:**
When feeling depressed during flares, experiencing **dysthymia (baseline) + situational depression (from being sick)**. When physically okay, return to baseline dysthymia, which feels "good" relative to flares but still has underlying emptiness.

### Social Anxiety & Isolation:
- Social anxiety actually IMPROVED significantly over last 10 years (through exposure/work/dates)
- Before: unemployed, not working or studying
- Increased isolation last 3-5 years due to:
  * Divorce (3 years ago)
  * COVID/remote work (5 years)
- Still uncomfortable and unable to relax around others
- Social interactions remain draining
- Recovery time: ~1 hour if interaction went well, full day+ if conflict
- Rehearse conversations before, replay them after
- Digital interactions (Slack, emails) also trigger anxiety
- Body image issues and dating anxiety (especially now with illness)
- Loneliness as major stressor

### Cognitive Patterns:
- Focus heavily on inner world, "staying in head"
- Inability to look away from bodily discomfort
- Clenching (teeth, fists, muscles) throughout day
- Mental energy consumed by appearance/dating/loneliness thoughts

## Current Psychiatric Medications (as of October 2025)
- **Escitalopram**: 10mg daily (started 5 weeks ago, no improvement in symptoms so far)
- **Pregabalin**: 75mg x2 (total duration: over 1 year; started at 75mg x2, increased to 150mg x2 for several months, decreased back to 75mg x2 several months ago)
- **Mirtazapine**: 15mg (total duration: ~6 months; started at 15mg, increased to 30mg for ~4 months, decreased back to 15mg several months ago)
- **Гидазепам (Gidazepam)**: 20-40mg daily, 30 mg last 2 months, consistently taking for the last 5 months total

## Previous Psychiatric Medications
- **Ketamine Therapy**: completed
  * No direct improvement in throat/inflammatory symptoms
  * Moderate psychological benefits observed
- **NAC**: 2400mg daily
- **Baclofen**: 10mg x3 daily for 2 months - no improvement for reflux management
- **L-theanine**: 200mg
- **Magnesium Glycinate**: 400mg x2

## Previous Therapy
- CBT for 4 months (4 years ago)
- CBT for 6 months (6 years ago)
- Currently completed ketamine therapy course

## Working Hypothesis

**Primary Mechanism:**
Chronic stress and constant nervous system activation caused autonomic dysfunction, which triggered/worsened an autoimmune/autoinflammatory process. Body may be treating everyday stress as survival threats, triggering inflammatory cascades.

**Deeper Root:**
The nervous system dysregulation may stem from a fundamental inability to feel safe, likely originating in childhood temperament (shy, vulnerable, anxious) and reinforced through decades of social phobia and chronic tension. This creates a pattern where:
- Discomfort (physical or emotional) triggers automatic resistance/suppression
- Fear of discomfort maintains hypervigilance
- Unable to relax because relaxing means fully experiencing discomfort
- Nervous system remains in defensive mode regardless of external circumstances

**Evidence Against Simple Stress Model:**
Extended periods without overactivation (summer 2025 vacation, October 2025 retreat) did not resolve inflammatory episode, suggesting:
- Either the condition has become self-perpetuating
- Or the root dysregulation is deeper than situational stress
- Or the nervous system changes persist even without acute stressors

## Key Insights
- It's not worry or catastrophic thinking - it's physical activation without discharge
- Long walks help (discharge activation)
- Benzodiazepines work (force nervous system calm)
- Passive rest doesn't help (activation remains)
- Everything becomes physical symptoms
- Extended rest periods without stress don't resolve the condition, suggesting deeper nervous system dysregulation
